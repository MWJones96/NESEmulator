/*
    AND - "AND" Memory with Accumulator

    Operation: A âˆ§ M â†’ A

    The AND instruction transfer the accumulator and memory to the adder 
    which performs a bit-by-bit AND operation and stores the result back 
    in the accumulator.

    This instruction affects the accumulator; sets the zero flag if the 
    result in the accumulator is 0, otherwise resets the zero flag; 
    sets the negative flag if the result in the accumulator has bit 7 on, 
    otherwise resets the negative flag.
