/*
    Relative

    Relative addressing is used only with branch instructions and
    establishes a destination for the conditional branch.

    The second byte of-the instruction becomes the operand which
    is an “Offset" added to the contents of the lower eight bits
    of the program counter when the counter is set at the next
    instruction. The range of the offset is —128 to +127 bytes
    from the next instruction.

    Bytes: 2
